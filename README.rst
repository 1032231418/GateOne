About Gate One
==============
Gate One is an HTML5 web-based terminal emulator and SSH client.  Top features:

    * No browser plugins required!
    * Supports multiple simultaneous terminal sessions.  As many as your hardware can handle.
    * Users can re-connect to their running terminals whenever they like from anywhere.
    * Can be embedded into other applications.  Add a terminal--running whatever application(s) you want--to your web app!  Would be vastly superior to say, a Java-based serial console applet (hint hint).
    * Includes powerful plugin system that supports plugins written in Python, JavaScript, and even CSS (yes, you can write a CSS-only plugin).
    * The Gate One server can be stopped & started without users losing their running terminal applications (even SSH sessions stay connected!).  In essence, worry-free upgrades!
    * The SSH plugin allows users to duplicate sessions without having to re-enter their username and password (it re-uses the existing SSH tunnel).
    * Provides users with the ability to play back and save/share their terminal sessions via a self-contained HTML playback file.
    * Similarly, supports server-side logging, recording, and video-like playback of user sessions.  It can even log to syslog to support whatever centralized logging system you want.
    * Keberos-based Single Sign-on support is included.  It even works with Active Directory.  Other authentication options are available as well.

Origins
-------
FYI:  Gate One was developed entirely by one guy in his spare time over the course of ~9 months.  It turned out pretty good so he's looking to start a business out of it.  What better way to create jobs than to start by creating one for yourself?   All feedback, tips, and advice is appreciated:
